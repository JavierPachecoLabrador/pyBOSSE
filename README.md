# pyBOSSE

## Synopsis

This project contains experimental *Python* code for the *BOSSE v1.0: the Biodiversity Observing System Simulation Experiment* (pyBOSSE) model using simulating temporally dynamic scenes of species maps, vegeation traits and associated remote sensing imagery for the development of remote sensing methods for the quantification of plant diversity and biodiveristy-ecosyste function relationships. 

pyBOSSE incorporates the following packages: an updated version of **pyGNDiv** code (https://github.com/JavierPachecoLabrador/pyGNDiv-master) computing normalized plant functional diversity metrics from spectral and plant trait variables, **pyet** for the computation of potential evapotranspiration (https://github.com/pyet-org/pyet), and **NLMpy** (https://github.com/tretherington/nlmpy) for the generation of random landscapes.

The BOSSE model is implemented in a class, after the class and the scene to be simulated are initialized, the class can provide simulations of plant trait maps, ecosystem functions and remote sensing signals at any time step of the meteorological time series. This repository contains a *Jupyter* tutorial script (**tutorial_bosse_v1_0.ipynb**) to show how to run pyBOSSE, and the *Python* script (**ManuscriptFigures.py**) reproducing the figures of the associated manuscript.

A reduced set of meteorological data necessary to run pyBOSSE are provide in the folder ./BOSSE_inputs/Meteo_ERA5Land/, a larger dataset useful to run a larger variety of simulations can be found in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14717038

## Installation
The following Python libraries will be required:
    - python=3.11
    - dask
	- git+https://github.com/JavierPachecoLabrador/pyGNDiv-master
    - h5netcdf
    - joblib
    - jupyter
    - matplotlib
    - netCDF4
    - notebook
    - numpy
	- nlmpy
    - pandas=2.1.1
    - pyet
	- python-rle
    - python-wget
    - scipy
    - scikit-learn=1.3.1
    - scikit-image
    - seaborn
    - regex
    - shapely
    - pickledb
    - pip
    - xarray

With `conda`, you can create a complete environment with
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

or with pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

if there were any issues during the installation of the **pyGNDiv** package, try either:
	```bash
	pip install git+https://github.com/JavierPachecoLabrador/pyGNDiv-master
	```
or
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/JavierPachecoLabrador/pyGNDiv-master.git
	cd pyGNDiv-master/
	python setup.py install
	```

Then you call the BOSSE model by inserting the folder containing code and datasets as follows:
```python
sys.path.insert(0, path_bosse)
from BOSSE.bosse import BosseModel
```
